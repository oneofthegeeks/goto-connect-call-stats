# Example configuration.yaml entry for GoTo Connect Call Stats
# This integration is designed to be configured through the UI (config flow)
# rather than through configuration.yaml

# If you need to configure via YAML, use this format:
goto_connect_call_stats:
  client_id: "your_client_id_here"
  client_secret: "your_client_secret_here"

# Note: It's recommended to use the UI configuration instead
# Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration
# Search for "GoTo Connect Call Stats" and follow the setup wizard
